# Great Noise

This is a prototype for a composable noise generator that will allow, creating
multiple layers of noise via composition. It currently implements PerlinNoise.

## Algorithms
Current state of algorithms and features:

- [x] PerlinNoise
- [x] FBM
- [ ] SimplexNoise
- [ ] Voronoi
- [ ] DomainWarping
- [ ] ValueNoise
- [ ] Smooth voronoi

## Organization

The NoisePresentation project is an example project of the usage of the
generated noise map. The library itself is located at the NoiseGenerator
project.

## License

The current program is licensed under the MIT license.
